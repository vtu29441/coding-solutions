# Java Comparator

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

Comparators are used to compare two objects. In this challenge, you'll create a comparator and use it to sort an array.

The *Player* class is provided for you in your editor. It has $2$ fields: a $name$ String and a $score$ integer.

Given an array of $n$ *Player* objects, write a comparator that sorts them in order of decreasing score; if $2$ or more players have the same score, sort those players alphabetically by name. To do this, you must create a *Checker* class that implements the *Comparator* interface, then write an *int compare(Player a, Player b)* method implementing the [Comparator.compare(T o1, T o2)](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Comparator.html#compare(T,%20T)) method.

**Input Format**

Input from stdin is handled by the locked stub code in the *Solution* class.	

The first line contains an integer, $n$, denoting the number of players. 	
Each of the $n$ subsequent lines contains a player's $name$ and $score$, respectively.

**Constraints**

- $0 \le score \le 1000$
- $2$ players can have the same name.
- Player names consist of lowercase English letters.

**Output Format**

You are not responsible for printing any output to stdout. The locked stub code in *Solution* will create a *Checker* object, use it to sort the *Player* array, and print each sorted element.

```java
import java.util.*;

// Your Checker class
class Checker implements Comparator<Player> {
    @Override
    public int compare(Player a, Player b) {
        // If scores are the same, sort alphabetically by name
        if (a.score == b.score) {
            return a.name.compareTo(b.name);
        }
        // Otherwise, sort in decreasing order of score
        return b.score - a.score;
    }
}

// The Player class HackerRank expects
class Player {
    String name;
    int score;
    
    Player(String name, int score) {
        this.name = name;
        this.score = score;
    }
}

// The Solution stub code to handle inputs and outputs
public class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scan.nextInt();

        Player[] player = new Player[n];
        Checker checker = new Checker();
        
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            player[i] = new Player(scan.next(), scan.nextInt());
        }
        scan.close();
 
        Arrays.sort(player, checker);
        for(int i = 0; i < player.length; i++){
            System.out.printf("%s %s\n", player[i].name, player[i].score);
        }
    }
}

```
