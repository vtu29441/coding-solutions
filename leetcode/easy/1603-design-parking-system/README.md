# Design Parking System

## Problem

Design a parking system for a parking lot. The parking lot has three kinds of parking spaces: big, medium, and small, with a fixed number of slots for each size.

Implement the `ParkingSystem` class:

- ParkingSystem(int big, int medium, int small) Initializes object of the ParkingSystem class. The number of slots for each parking space are given as part of the constructor.
- bool addCar(int carType) Checks whether there is a parking space of carType for the car that wants to get into the parking lot. carType can be of three kinds: big, medium, or small, which are represented by 1, 2, and 3 respectively. A car can only park in a parking space of its carType. If there is no space available, return false, else park the car in that size space and return true.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input
["ParkingSystem", "addCar", "addCar", "addCar", "addCar"]
[[1, 1, 0], [1], [2], [3], [1]]
Output
[null, true, true, false, false]

Explanation
ParkingSystem parkingSystem = new ParkingSystem(1, 1, 0);
parkingSystem.addCar(1); // return true because there is 1 available slot for a big car
parkingSystem.addCar(2); // return true because there is 1 available slot for a medium car
parkingSystem.addCar(3); // return false because there is no available slot for a small car
parkingSystem.addCar(1); // return false because there is no available slot for a big car. It is already occupied.

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 0 <= big, medium, small <= 1000
- carType is 1, 2, or 3
- At most 1000 calls will be made to addCar

```java
class ParkingSystem {
    // Array to store the available slots. 
    // Size is 4 to directly map carType (1, 2, 3) to array indices.
    private int[] spaces;

    public ParkingSystem(int big, int medium, int small) {
        spaces = new int[]{0, big, medium, small};
    }
    
    public boolean addCar(int carType) {
        // Check if there is space available for the specific carType
        if (spaces[carType] > 0) {
            spaces[carType]--; // Decrement the available slots
            return true;
        }
        return false; // No slots available
    }
}
```
